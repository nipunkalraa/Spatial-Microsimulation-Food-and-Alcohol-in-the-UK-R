This project uses spatial microsimulation techniques to estimate the average daily consumption of various food and drink items, most notably alcohol, across Oxford's Lower Super Output Areas (LSOAs). It generates high-resolution, synthetic population data that is statistically aligned with official demographics, enabling localised public health insights.

# üîß Methods & Workflow
Microsimulation Engine: An Iterative Proportional Fitting Procedure (IPFP) matches synthetic individuals to area-level demographic constraints.

# Constraint Variables:
Age-Sex combinations, Ethnicity, Health status, Employment status

# Consumption Outputs:

Estimated daily intake of 13 items, including meats (e.g., pork, beef), plant-based foods (fruits, vegetables), and alcohol.

# üìä Datasets Used

individuals.csv ‚Äì Synthetic individuals with consumption attributes | 

Constraint datasets (age_sex.csv, Ethnicity.csv, Health.csv, Work.csv) ‚Äì UK 2011 Census-based marginal totals | 

Geographic Focus: Final simulation and visualization are filtered for Oxford, UK (70+ LSOAs)

# üì¶ Packages Used

tidyverse ‚Äì Data wrangling and transformation | 

ipfp ‚Äì Iterative proportional fitting algorithm | 

sf, tmap ‚Äì Spatial data manipulation and visualisation |

# üñºÔ∏è Map Interpretation
The choropleth map shows spatial variation in average alcohol consumption (ml/day) at the LSOA level in Oxford. Darker regions indicate higher per capita intake.

# ‚úÖ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how spatial microsimulation can turn limited survey data into rich, small-area estimates.
